## Introduction
Our system enables the users to perform computation on their joint data, while keeping each user's data private, this is done in a shared-secret form. The output of the computation is saved in the servers for following processes.

The application is composed of four components: 
- A randomness client that runs offline.
- Two remote servers that perform the computations.
- A data client that is in charge of getting the input from the users and send it to the servers.

When the users run the application, they run the data client component.
